title: 'InBiaseD: Inductive Bias Distillation to Improve Generalization and Robustness
  through Shape-awareness'
abstract: Humans rely less on spurious correlations and trivial cues, such as texture,
  compared to deep neural networks which lead to better generalization and robustness.
  It can be attributed to the prior knowledge or the high-level cognitive inductive
  bias present in the brain. Therefore, introducing meaningful inductive bias to neural
  networks can help learn more generic and high-level representations and alleviate
  some of the shortcomings. We propose InBiaseD to distill inductive bias and bring
  shape-awareness to the neural networks. Our method includes a bias alignment objective
  that enforces the networks to learn more generic representations that are less vulnerable
  to unintended cues in the data which results in improved generalization performance.
  InBiaseD is less susceptible to shortcut learning and also exhibits lower texture
  bias. The better representations also aid in improving robustness to adversarial
  attacks and we hence plugin InBiaseD seamlessly into the existing adversarial training
  schemes to show a better trade-off between generalization and robustness.
