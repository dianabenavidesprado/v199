title: Sparsity and Heterogeneous Dropout for Continual Learning in the Null Space
  of Neural Activations
abstract: Continual/lifelong learning from a non-stationary input data stream is a
  cornerstone of intelligence. Despite their phenomenal performance in a wide variety
  of applications, deep neural networks are prone to forgetting their previously learned
  information upon learning new ones. This phenomenon is called “catastrophic forgetting”
  and is deeply rooted in the stability-plasticity dilemma. Overcoming catastrophic
  forgetting in deep neural networks has become an active field of research in recent
  years. In particular, gradient projection-based methods have recently shown exceptional
  performance at overcoming catastrophic forgetting. This paper proposes two biologically-inspired
  mechanisms based on sparsity and heterogeneous dropout that significantly increase
  a continual learner’s performance over a long sequence of tasks. Our proposed approach
  builds on the Gradient Projection Memory (GPM) framework. We leverage k-winner activations
  in each layer of a neural network to enforce layer-wise sparse activations for each
  task, together with a between-task heterogeneous dropout that encourages the network
  to use non-overlapping activation patterns between different tasks. In addition,
  we introduce two new benchmarks for continual learning under distributional shift,
  namely Continual Swiss Roll and ImageNet SuperDog-40. Lastly, we provide an in-depth
  analysis of our proposed method and demonstrate a significant performance boost
  on various benchmark continual learning problems.
