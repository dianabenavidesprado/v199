title: 'Lifelong DP: Consistently Bounded Differential Privacy in Lifelong Machine
  Learning'
abstract: 'In this paper, we show that the process of continually learning new tasks
  and memorizing previous tasks introduces unknown privacy risks and challenges to
  bound the privacy loss. Based upon this, we introduce a formal definition of Lifelong
  DP, in which the participation of any data tuples in the training set of any tasks
  is protected, under a consistently bounded DP protection, given a growing stream
  of tasks. A consistently bounded DP means having only one fixed value of the DP
  privacy budget, regardless of the number of tasks. To preserve Lifelong DP, we propose
  a scalable and heterogeneous algorithm, called L2DP-ML with a streaming batch training,
  to efficiently train and continue releasing new versions of an L2M model, given
  the heterogeneity in terms of data sizes and the training order of tasks, without
  affecting DP protection of the private training set. An end-to-end theoretical analysis
  and thorough evaluations show that our mechanism is significantly better than baseline
  approaches in preserving Lifelong DP. The implementation of L2DP-ML is available
  at: https://github.com/haiphanNJIT/PrivateDeepLearning.'
