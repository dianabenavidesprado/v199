title: Improved Policy Optimization for Online Imitation Learning
abstract: We consider online imitation learning (OIL), where the task is to find a
  policy that imitates the behavior of an expert via active interaction with the environment.
  We aim to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of policy optimization
  algorithms for OIL by analyzing one of the most popular OIL algorithms, DAGGER.
  Specifically, if the class of policies is sufficiently expressive to contain the
  expert policy, we prove that DAGGER achieves constant regret. Unlike previous bounds
  that require the losses to be strongly-convex, our result only requires the weaker
  assumption that the losses be strongly-convex with respect to the policyâ€™s sufficient
  statistics (not its parameterization). In order to ensure convergence for a wider
  class of policies and losses, we augment DAGGER with an additional regularization
  term. In particular, we propose a variant of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL)
  and its adaptive variant for OIL and develop a memory-efficient implementation,
  which matches the memory requirements of FTL. Assuming that the loss functions are
  smooth and convex with respect to the parameters of the policy, we also prove that
  FTRL achieves constant regret for any sufficiently expressive policy class, while
  retaining $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret in the worst-case. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of these algorithms with experiments on synthetic and high-dimensional control tasks.
