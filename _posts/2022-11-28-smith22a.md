title: Learning Skills Diverse in Value-Relevant Features
abstract: Behavioural abstraction via temporally extended actions is vital to solving
  large-scale reinforcement learning problems. Skills structure exploration, speed
  up credit assignment, and can be used in transfer learning. However, such abstraction
  is often difficult or expensive for experts to craft by hand. Unsupervised information-theoretic
  methods (Gregor et al., 2016; Eysenbach et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2020) address
  this problem by learning a set of skills without using environment rewards, typically
  by maximizing discriminability of the states visited by individual skills.  However,
  since only some features of the state matter in complex environments, these methods
  often discover behaviours that are trivially diverse, learning skills that are not
  helpful for downstream tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a method for
  learning skills that only control features important to the tasks of interest. First,
  by training on a small set of source tasks, the agent learns which features are
  most relevant.  Then, the discriminability objective for an unsupervised information-theoretic
  method is defined for this learned feature space. This allows the construction of
  sets of diverse and useful skills that can control the most important features.
  Experimental results in continuous control domains validate our method, demonstrating
  that it yields skills that substantially improve learning on downstream locomotion
  tasks with sparse rewards.
