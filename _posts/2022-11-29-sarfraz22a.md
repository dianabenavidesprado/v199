title: SYNERgy between SYNaptic Consolidation and Experience Replay for General Continual
  Learning
abstract: Continual learning (CL) in the brain is facilitated by a complex set of
  mechanisms. This includes the interplay of multiple memory systems for consolidating
  information as posited by the complementary learning systems (CLS) theory and synaptic
  consolidation for protecting the acquired knowledge from erasure. Therefore, we
  propose a general CL method that creates a synergy between SYNaptic consolidation
  and dual memory Experience Replay (SYNERgy). Our method maintains a semantic memory
  that accumulates and consolidates information across the tasks and interacts with
  the episodic memory for effective replay. It further employs synaptic consolidation
  by tracking the importance of parameters during the training trajectory and anchoring
  them to the consolidated parameters in the semantic memory. To the best of our knowledge,
  our study is the first to employ dual memory experience replay and synaptic consolidation
  in conjunction which is suitable for general CL whereby the network does not utilize
  task boundaries or task labels during training or inference. Our extensive evaluation
  on various challenging CL scenarios and characteristics analyzes demonstrate the
  efficacy of incorporating both synaptic consolidation and CLS theory in enabling
  effective CL in DNNs.
