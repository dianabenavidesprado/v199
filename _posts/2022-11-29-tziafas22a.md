title: Sim-To-Real Transfer of Visual Grounding for Human-Aided Ambiguity Resolution
abstract: Service robots should be able to interact naturally with non-expert human
  users, not only to help them in various tasks but also to receive guidance in order
  to resolve ambiguities that might be present in the instruction. We consider the
  task of visual grounding, where the agent segments an object from a crowded scene
  given a natural language description. Modern holistic approaches to visual grounding
  usually ignore language structure and struggle to cover generic domains, therefore
  relying heavily on large datasets. Additionally, their transfer performance in RGB-D
  datasets suffers due to high visual discrepancy between the benchmark and the target
  domains. Modular approaches marry learning with domain modeling and exploit the
  compositional nature of language to decouple visual representation from language
  parsing, but either rely on external parsers or are trained in an end-to-end fashion
  due to the lack of strong supervision. In this work, we seek to tackle these limitations
  by introducing a fully decoupled modular framework for compositional visual grounding
  of entities, attributes, and spatial relations. We exploit rich scene graph annotations
  generated in a synthetic domain and train each module independently.  Our approach
  is evaluated both in simulation and in two real RGB-D scene datasets. Experimental
  results show that the decoupled nature of our framework allows for easy integration
  with domain adaptation approaches for Sim-To-Real visual recognition, offering a
  data-efficient, robust, and interpretable solution to visual grounding in robotic
  applications.
