title: 'Inexperienced RL Agents Can’t Get It Right: Lower Bounds on Regret at Finite
  Sample Complexity'
abstract: We consider a family $\mathcal M$ of MDPs over given state and action spaces,
  and an agent that is sequentially confronted with tasks from $\mathcal M$. Although
  stated for this stepwise change in distributions, the insight we develop is informative
  for continually changing distributions as well. In order to study how structure
  of $\mathcal M$, viewed as a learning environment, impacts the learning efficiency
  of the agent, we formulate an RL analog of fat shattering dimension for MDP families
  and show that this implies a nontrivial lower bound on regret as long as insufficiently
  many steps have been taken. More precisely, for some constant $c$ which depends
  on shattering $d$ states, an inexperienced agent that has explored the learning
  environment for fewer than $d$ steps will necessarily have regret above $c$ on some
  MDP in the family.
