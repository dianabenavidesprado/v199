title: Self-Activating Neural Ensembles for Continual Reinforcement Learning
abstract: The ability for an agent to continuously learn new skills without catastrophically
  forgetting existing knowledge is of critical importance for the development of generally
  intelligent agents. Most methods devised to address this problem depend heavily
  on well-defined task boundaries, and thus depend on human supervision. Our task-agnostic
  method, Self-Activating Neural Ensembles (SANE), uses a modular architecture designed
  to avoid catastrophic forgetting without making any such assumptions. At the beginning
  of each trajectory, a module in the SANE ensemble is activated to determine the
  agentâ€™s next policy. During training, new modules are created as needed and only
  activated modules are updated to ensure that unused modules remain unchanged. This
  system enables our method to retain and leverage old skills, while growing and learning
  new ones. We demonstrate our approach on visually rich procedurally generated environments.
