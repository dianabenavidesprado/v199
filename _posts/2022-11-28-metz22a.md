title: Practical Tradeoffs between Memory, Compute, and Performance in Learned Optimizers
abstract: Optimization plays a costly and crucial role in developing machine learning
  systems. In learned optimizers, the few hyperparameters of commonly used hand-designed
  optimizers, e.g. Adam or SGD, are replaced with flexible parametric functions. The
  parameters of these functions are then optimized so that the resulting learned optimizer
  minimizes a target loss on a chosen class of models. Learned optimizers can both
  reduce the number of required training steps and improve the final test loss. However,
  they can be expensive to train, and once trained can be expensive to use due to
  computational and memory overhead for the optimizer itself. In this work, we identify
  and quantify the design features governing the memory, compute, and performance
  trade-offs for many learned and hand-designed optimizers. We further leverage our
  analysis to construct a learned optimizer that is both faster and more memory efficient
  than previous work. Our model and training code are open source.
