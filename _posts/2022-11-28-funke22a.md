title: Disentanglement and Generalization Under Correlation Shifts
abstract: Correlations between factors of variation are prevalent in real-world data.
  Exploiting such correlations may increase predictive performance on noisy data;
  however, often correlations are not robust (e.g., they may change between domains,
  datasets, or applications) and models that exploit them do not generalize when correlations
  shift. Disentanglement methods aim to learn representations which capture different
  factors of variation in latent subspaces. A common approach involves minimizing
  the mutual information between latent subspaces, such that each encodes a single
  underlying attribute. However, this fails when attributes are correlated. We solve
  this problem by enforcing independence between subspaces conditioned on the available
  attributes, which allows us to remove only dependencies that are not due to the
  correlation structure present in the training data. We achieve this via an adversarial
  approach to minimize the conditional mutual information (CMI) between subspaces
  with respect to categorical variables. We first show theoretically that CMI minimization
  is a good objective for robust disentanglement on linear problems. We then apply
  our method on real-world datasets based on MNIST and CelebA, and show that it yields
  models that are disentangled and robust under correlation shift, including in weakly
  supervised settings.
