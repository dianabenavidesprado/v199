title: Streaming Inference for Infinite Non-Stationary Clustering
abstract: Learning from a continuous stream of non-stationary data in an unsupervised
  manner is arguably one of the most common and most challenging settings facing intelligent
  agents. Here, we attack learning under all three conditions (unsupervised, streaming,
  non-stationary) in the context of clustering, also known as mixture modeling. We
  introduce a novel clustering algorithm that endows mixture models with the ability
  to create new clusters online, as demanded by the data, in a probabilistic, time-varying,
  and principled manner. To achieve this, we first define a novel stochastic process
  called the Dynamical Chinese Restaurant Process (Dynamical CRP), which is a non-exchangeable
  distribution over partitions of a set; next, we show that the Dynamical CRP provides
  a non-stationary prior over cluster assignments and yields an efficient streaming
  variational inference algorithm. We conclude with experiments showing that the Dynamical
  CRP can be applied on diverse synthetic and real data with Gaussian and non-Gaussian
  likelihoods.
