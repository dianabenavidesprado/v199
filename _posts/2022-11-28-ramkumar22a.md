title: Differencing based Self-supervised pretraining for Scene Change Detection
abstract: Scene change detection (SCD), a crucial perception task, identifies changes
  by comparing scenes captured at different times. SCD is challenging due to noisy
  changes in illumination, seasonal variations, and perspective differences across
  a pair of views. Deep neural networks (DNNs)-based solutions require a large quantity
  of annotated data which is tedious and expensive to obtain. On the other hand, transfer
  learning from large datasets induces domain shift. To address these challenges,
  we propose a novel Differencing Self-supervised Pretraining  (DSP) method that uses
  feature differencing to learn discriminatory representations corresponding to the
  changed regions while simultaneously tackling the noisy changes by enforcing temporal
  invariance across views. Our experimental results on SCD datasets demonstrate the
  effectiveness of our method, specifically to differences in camera viewpoints and
  lighting conditions. Compared against the standard ImageNet pretraining that uses
  more than a million additional labeled images, DSP can surpass it without using
  any additional data. Our results also demonstrate the robustness of DSP to natural
  corruptions, distribution shift, and learning under limited labeled data.
