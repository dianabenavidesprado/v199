title: Continual Novelty Detection
abstract: Novelty Detection methods identify samples that are not representative of
  a modelâ€™s training set thereby flagging misleading predictions and bringing a greater
  flexibility and transparency at deployment time. However, research in this area
  has only considered Novelty Detection in the offline setting.  Recently, there has
  been a growing realization in the computer vision community that applications demand
  a more flexible framework - Continual Learning - where new batches of data representing
  new domains, new classes or new tasks become available at different points in time.
  In this setting, Novelty Detection becomes more important, interesting and challenging.
  This work identifies the crucial link between the two problems and investigates
  the Novelty Detection problem under the Continual Learning setting. We formulate
  the Continual Novelty Detection problem and present a benchmark, where we compare
  several Novelty Detection methods under different Continual Learning settings.  We
  show that Continual Learning affects the behaviour of novelty detection algorithms,
  while novelty detection can pinpoint insights in the behaviour of a continual learner.
  We further propose baselines and discuss possible research directions. We believe
  that the coupling of the two problems is a promising direction to bring vision models
  into practice.
