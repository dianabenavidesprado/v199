title: 'How do Quadratic Regularizers Prevent Catastrophic Forgetting: The Role of
  Interpolation'
abstract: 'Catastrophic forgetting undermines the effectiveness of deep neural networks
  (DNNs) in scenarios such as continual learning and lifelong learning. While several
  methods have been proposed to tackle this problem, there is limited work explaining
  why these methods work well. This paper has the goal of better explaining a popularly
  used technique for avoiding catastrophic forgetting: quadratic regularization. We
  show that quadratic regularizers prevent forgetting of past tasks by interpolating
  current and previous values of model parameters at every training iteration. Over
  multiple training iterations, this interpolation operation reduces the learning
  rates of more important model parameters, thereby minimizing their movement. Our
  analysis also reveals two drawbacks of quadratic regularization: (a) dependence
  of parameter interpolation on training hyperparameters, which often leads to training
  instability and (b) assignment of lower importance to deeper layers, which are generally
  the place forgetting occurs in DNNs. Via a simple modification to the order of operations,
  we show these drawbacks can be easily avoided, resulting in 6.2% higher average
  accuracy at 4.5% lower average forgetting. We confirm the robustness of our results
  by training over 2000 models in different settings.'
