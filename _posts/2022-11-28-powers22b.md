title: 'CORA: Benchmarks, Baselines, and Metrics as a Platform for Continual Reinforcement
  Learning Agents'
abstract: 'Progress in continual reinforcement learning has been limited due to several
  barriers to entry: missing code, high compute requirements, and a lack of suitable
  benchmarks. In this work, we present CORA, a platform for Continual Reinforcement
  Learning Agents that provides benchmarks, baselines, and metrics in a single code
  package. The benchmarks we provide are designed to evaluate different aspects of
  the continual RL challenge, such as catastrophic forgetting, plasticity, ability
  to generalize, and sample-efficient learning. Three of the benchmarks utilize video
  game environments (Atari, Procgen, NetHack). The fourth benchmark, CHORES, consists
  of four different task sequences in a visually realistic home simulator, drawn from
  a diverse set of task and scene parameters. To compare continual RL methods on these
  benchmarks, we prepare three metrics in CORA: Continual Evaluation, Isolated Forgetting,
  and Zero-Shot Forward Transfer. Finally, CORA includes a set of performant, open-source
  baselines of existing algorithms for researchers to use and expand on. We release
  CORA and hope that the continual RL community can benefit from our contributions,
  to accelerate the development of new continual RL algorithms.'
