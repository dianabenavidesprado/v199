title: Trustworthiness Evaluation and Trust-Aware Design of CNN Architectures
abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are known to be effective tools in
  many deep learning application areas. Despite CNNâ€™s good performance in terms of
  classical evaluation metrics such as accuracy and loss, quantifying and ensuring
  a high degree of trustworthiness of such models remains an unsolved problem raising
  questions in applications where trust is an important factor. In this work, we propose
  a framework to evaluate the trustworthiness of CNNs. Towards this end, we develop
  a trust-based pooling layer for CNNs to achieve higher accuracy and trustworthiness
  in applications with noise in input features. We further propose TrustCNets consisting
  of trustworthiness-aware CNN building blocks, i.e., one or more conv layers followed
  by a trust-based pooling layer. TrustCNets can stack together as a trust-aware CNN
  architecture or be plugged into deep learning architectures to improve performance.
  In our experiments, we evaluate the trustworthiness of popular CNN building blocks
  and demonstrate the performance of our TrustCNet empirically with multiple datasets.
