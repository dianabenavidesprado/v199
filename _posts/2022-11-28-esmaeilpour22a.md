title: Open Set Recognition Via Augmentation-Based Similarity Learning
abstract: The primary assumption of conventional supervised learning or classification
  is that the test samples are drawn from the same distribution as the training samples,
  which is called closed set learning or classification. In many practical scenarios,
  this is not the case because there are unknowns or unseen class samples in the test
  data, which is called the open set scenario, and the unknowns need to be detected.
  This problem is referred to as the open set recognition problem and is important
  in safety-critical applications. We propose to detect unknowns (or unseen class
  samples) through learning pairwise similarities. The proposed method works in two
  steps. It first learns a closed set classifier using the seen classes that have
  appeared in training and then, learns how to compare seen classes with pseudo-unseen
  (automatically generated unseen class samples). The pseudo-unseen generation is
  carried out by performing distribution shifting augmentations on the seen or training
  samples. We call our method OPG (Open set recognition based on Pseudo unseen data
  Generation). The experimental evaluation shows that the learned similarity-based
  features can successfully distinguish seen from unseen in benchmark datasets for
  open set recognition.
