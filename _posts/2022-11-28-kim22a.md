title: A Multi-Head Model for Continual Learning via Out-of-Distribution Replay
abstract: This paper studies class incremental learning (CIL) of continual learning
  (CL).  Many approaches have been proposed to deal with catastrophic forgetting (CF)
  in CIL. Most methods incrementally construct a single classifier for all classes
  of all tasks in a single head network. To prevent CF, a popular approach is to memorize
  a small number of samples from previous tasks and replay them during  training of
  the new task. However, this approach still suffers from serious CF as the parameters
  learned for previous tasks are updated or adjusted with only the limited number
  of saved samples in the memory. This paper proposes an entirely different approach
  that builds a separate classifier (head) for each task (called a multi-head model)
  using a transformer network, called MORE. Instead of using the saved samples in
  memory to update the network for previous tasks/classes in the existing approach,
  MORE leverages the saved samples to build a task specific classifier (adding a new
  classification head) without updating the network learned for previous tasks/classes.
  The model for the new task in MORE is trained to learn the classes of the task and
  also to detect samples that are not from the same data distribution (i.e., out-of-distribution
  (OOD)) of the task. This enables the classifier for the task to which the test instance
  belongs to produce a high score for the correct class and the classifiers of other
  tasks to produce low scores because the test instance is not from the data distributions
  of these classifiers. Experimental results show that MORE outperforms state-of-the-art
  baselines and is also naturally capable of performing OOD detection in the continual
  learning setting.
