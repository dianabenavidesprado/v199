title: 'Task Agnostic Representation Consolidation: a Self-supervised based Continual
  Learning Approach'
abstract: Continual learning (CL) over non-stationary data streams remains one of
  the long-standing challenges in deep neural networks (DNNs) as they are prone to
  catastrophic forgetting. CL models can benefit from self-supervised pre-training
  as it enables learning more generalizable task-agnostic features. However, the effect
  of self-supervised pre-training diminishes as the length of task sequences increases.
  Furthermore, the domain shift between pre-training data distribution and the task
  distribution reduces the generalizability of the learned representations. To address
  these limitations, we propose Task Agnostic Representation Consolidation (TARC),
  a novel two-stage training paradigm for CL that intertwines task-agnostic and task-specific
  learning whereby self-supervised training is followed by supervised learning for
  each task. To further restrict the deviation from the learned representations in
  the self-supervised stage, we employ a task-agnostic auxiliary loss during the supervised
  stage. We show that our training paradigm can be easily added to memory- or regularization-based
  approaches and provides consistent performance gain across more challenging CL settings.
  We further show that it leads to more robust and well-calibrated models.
