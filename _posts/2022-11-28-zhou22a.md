title: Forgetting and Imbalance in Robot Lifelong Learning with Off-policy Data
abstract: 'Robots will experience non-stationary environment dynamics throughout their
  lifetime:  the robot dynamics can change due to wear and tear, or its surroundings
  may change over time. Eventually, the robots should perform well in all of the environment
  variations it has encountered. At the same time, it should still be able to learn
  fast in a new environment. We identify two challenges in Reinforcement Learning
  (RL) under such a lifelong learning setting with off-policy data:  first, existing
  off-policy algorithms struggle with the trade-off between being conservative to
  maintain good performance in the old environment and learning efficiently in the
  new environment, despite keeping all the data in the replay buffer.  We propose
  the Offline Distillation Pipeline to break this trade-off by separating the training
  procedure into an online interaction phase and an offline distillation phase.Second,
  we find that training with the imbalanced off-policy data from multiple environments
  across the lifetime creates a significant performance drop. We identify that this
  performance drop is caused by the combination of the imbalanced quality and size
  among the datasets which exacerbate the extrapolation error of the Q-function. During
  the distillation phase, we apply a simple fix to the issue by keeping the policy
  closer to the behavior policy that generated the data.  In the experiments, we demonstrate
  these two challenges and the proposed solutions with a simulated bipedal robot walk-ing
  task across various environment changes. We show that the Offline Distillation Pipeline
  achieves better performance across all the encountered environments without affecting
  data collection.  We also provide a comprehensive empirical study to support our
  hypothesis on the data imbalance issue.'
