title: Few-Shot Learning by Dimensionality Reduction in Gradient Space
abstract: 'We introduce SubGD, a novel few-shot learning method which is based on
  the recent finding that stochastic gradient descent updates tend to live in a low-dimensional
  parameter subspace. In experimental and theoretical analyses, we show that models
  confined to a suitable predefined subspace generalize well for few-shot learning.
  A suitable subspace fulfills three criteria across the given tasks: it (a) allows
  to reduce the training error by gradient flow, (b) leads to models that generalize
  well, and (c) can be identified by stochastic gradient descent. SubGD identifies
  these subspaces from an eigendecomposition of the auto-correlation matrix of update
  directions across different tasks. Demonstrably, we can identify low-dimensional
  suitable subspaces for few-shot learning of dynamical systems, which have varying
  properties described by one or few parameters of the analytical system description.
  Such systems are ubiquitous among real-world applications in science and engineering.
  We experimentally corroborate the advantages of SubGD on three distinct dynamical
  systems problem settings, significantly outperforming popular few-shot learning
  methods both in terms of sample efficiency and performance.'
