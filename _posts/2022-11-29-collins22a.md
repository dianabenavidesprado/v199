title: How Does the Task Landscape Affect MAML Performance?
abstract: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) has become increasingly popular for
  training models that can quickly adapt to new tasks via one or few stochastic gradient
  descent steps. However, the MAML objective is significantly more difficult to optimize
  compared to standard non-adaptive learning (NAL), and little is understood about
  how much MAML improves over NAL in terms of the fast adaptability of their solutions
  in various scenarios. We analytically address this issue in a linear regression
  setting consisting of a mixture of easy and hard tasks, where hardness is related
  to the rate that gradient descent converges on the task. Specifically, we prove
  that in order for MAML to achieve substantial gain over NAL, (i) there must be some
  discrepancy in hardness among the tasks, and (ii) the optimal solutions of the hard
  tasks must be closely packed with the center far from the center of the easy tasks
  optimal solutions. We also give numerical and analytical results suggesting that
  these insights apply to two-layer neural networks. Finally, we provide few-shot
  image classification experiments that support our insights for when MAML should
  be used and emphasize the importance of training MAML on hard tasks in practice.
