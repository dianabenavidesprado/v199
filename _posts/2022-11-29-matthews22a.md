title: Hierarchical Kickstarting for Skill Transfer in Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Practising and honing skills forms a fundamental component of how humans
  learn, yet artificial agents are rarely specifically trained to perform them. Instead,
  they are usually trained end-to-end, with the hope being that useful skills will
  be implicitly learned in order to maximise discounted return of some extrinsic reward
  function. In this paper, we investigate how skills can be incorporated into the
  training of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in complex environments with large
  state-action spaces and sparse rewards. To this end, we created SkillHack, a benchmark
  of tasks and associated skills based on the game of NetHack. We evaluate a number
  of baselines on this benchmark, as well as our own novel skill-based method Hierarchical
  Kickstarting (HKS), which is shown to outperform all other evaluated methods. Our
  experiments show that learning with a prior knowledge of useful skills can significantly
  improve the performance of agents on complex problems. We ultimately argue that
  utilising predefined skills provides a useful inductive bias for RL problems, especially
  those with large state-action spaces and sparse rewards.
