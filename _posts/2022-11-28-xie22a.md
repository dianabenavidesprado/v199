title: Lifelong Robotic Reinforcement Learning by Retaining Experiences
abstract: Multi-task learning ideally allows embodied agents such as robots to acquire
  a diverse repertoire of useful skills. However, many multi-task reinforcement learning
  efforts assume the agent can collect data from all tasks at all times, which can
  be unrealistic for physical agents that can only attend to one task at a time. Motivated
  by the practical constraints of physical learning systems, this work studies lifelong
  learning as a more natural multi-task learning setup. We present an approach that
  effectively leverages data collected from previous tasks to cumulatively and efficiently
  grow the robotâ€™s skill-set. In a series of simulated robotic manipulation experiments,
  our approach requires less than half the samples than learning each task from scratch,
  while avoiding the impractical round-robin data collection scheme. On a Franka Emika
  Panda robot arm, our approach incrementally solves ten challenging tasks, including
  bottle capping and block insertion.
