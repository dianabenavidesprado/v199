title: Probing Transfer in Deep Reinforcement Learning without Task Engineering
abstract: We evaluate the use of original game curricula supported by the Atari 2600
  console as a heterogeneous transfer benchmark for deep reinforcement learning agents.
  Game designers created curricula using combinations of several discrete modifications
  to the basic versions of games such as Space Invaders, Breakout and Freeway, making
  them progressively more challenging for human players. By formally organising these
  modifications into several factors of variation, we are able to show that Analyses
  of Variance (ANOVA) are a potent tool for studying the effects of human-relevant
  domain changes on the learning and transfer performance of a deep reinforcement
  learning agent. Since no manual task engineering is needed on our part, leveraging
  the original multi-factorial design avoids the pitfalls of unintentionally biasing
  the experimental setup. We find that game design factors have a large and statistically
  significant impact on an agentâ€™s ability to learn, and so do their combinatorial
  interactions. Furthermore, we show that zero-shot transfer from the basic games
  to their respective variations is possible, but the variance in performance is also
  largely explained by interactions between factors. As such, we argue that Atari
  game curricula offer a challenging benchmark for transfer learning in RL, that can
  help the community better understand the generalisation capabilities of RL agents
  along dimensions which meaningfully impact human generalisation performance. As
  a start, we report that value-function finetuning of regularly trained agents achieves
  positive transfer in a majority of cases, but significant headroom for algorithmic
  innovation remains. We conclude with the observation that selective transfer from
  multiple variants could further improve performance.
