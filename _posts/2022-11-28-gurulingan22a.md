title: Curbing Task Interference using Representation Similarity-Guided Multi-Task
  Feature Sharing
abstract: Multi-task learning of dense prediction tasks, by sharing both the encoder
  and decoder, as opposed to sharing only the encoder, provides an attractive front
  to increase both accuracy and computational efficiency. When the tasks are similar,
  sharing the decoder serves as an additional inductive bias providing more room for
  tasks to share complementary information among themselves. However, increased sharing
  exposes more parameters to task interference which likely hinders both generalization
  and robustness. Effective ways to curb this interference while exploiting the inductive
  bias of sharing the decoder remains an open challenge. To address this challenge,
  we propose Progressive Decoder Fusion (PDF) to progressively combine task decoders
  based on inter-task representation similarity. We show that this procedure leads
  to a multi-task network with better generalization to in-distribution and out-of-distribution
  data and improved robustness to adversarial attacks. Additionally, we observe that
  the predictions of different tasks of this multi-task network are more consistent
  among each other.
