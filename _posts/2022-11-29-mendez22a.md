title: 'CompoSuite: A Compositional Reinforcement Learning Benchmark'
abstract: We present CompoSuite, an open-source simulated robotic manipulation benchmark
  for compositional multi-task reinforcement learning (RL). Each CompoSuite task requires
  a particular robot arm to manipulate one individual object to achieve a task objective
  while avoiding an obstacle. This compositional definition of the tasks endows CompoSuite
  with two remarkable properties. First, varying the robot/object/objective/obstacle
  elements leads to hundreds of RL tasks, each of which requires a meaningfully different
  behavior. Second, RL approaches can be evaluated specifically for their ability
  to learn the compositional structure of the tasks. This latter capability to functionally
  decompose problems would enable intelligent agents to identify and exploit commonalities
  between learning tasks to handle large varieties of highly diverse problems. We
  benchmark existing single-task, multi-task, and compositional learning algorithms
  on various training settings, and assess their capability to compositionally generalize
  to unseen tasks. Our evaluation exposes the shortcomings of existing RL approaches
  with respect to compositionality and opens new avenues for investigation.
