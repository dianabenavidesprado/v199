title: Learning Object-Centered Autotelic Behaviors with Graph Neural Networks
abstract: Although humans live in an open-ended world and endlessly face new challenges,
  they do not have to learn from scratch each time they face the next one. Rather,
  they have access to a handful of previously learned skills, which they rapidly adapt
  to new situations. In artificial intelligence, autotelic agents—which are intrinsically
  motivated to represent and set their own goals—exhibit promising skill adaptation
  capabilities. However, these capabilities are highly constrained by their policy
  and goal space representations. In this paper, we propose to investigate the impact
  of these representations on the learning capabilities of autotelic agents. We study
  different implementations of autotelic agents using four types of Graph Neural Networks
  policy representations and two types of goal spaces, either geometric or predicate-based.
  We show that combining object-centered architectures that are expressive enough
  with semantic relational goals enables an efficient transfer between skills and
  promotes behavioral diversity. We also release our graph-based implementations to
  encourage further research in this direction.
