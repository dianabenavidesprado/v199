title: 'CLActive: Episodic Memories for Rapid Active Learning'
abstract: 'Active Learning aims to solve the problem of alleviating labelling costs
  for large-scale datasets by selecting a subset of data to effectively train on.
  Deep Active Learning (DAL) techniques typically involve repeated training of a model
  for sample acquisition over the entire subset of labelled data available in each
  round. This can be prohibitively expensive to run in real-world scenarios with large
  and constantly growing data. Some work has been done to address this â€“ notably,
  Selection-Via-Proxy (SVP) proposed the use of a separate, smaller proxy model for
  acquisition. We explore further optimizations to the standard DAL setup and propose
  CLActive: an optimization procedure that brings significant speedups which maintains
  a constant training time for the selection model across rounds and retains information
  from past rounds using Experience Replay. We demonstrate large improvements in total
  train-time compared to the fully-trained baselines and SVP. We achieve up to 89$\times$,
  7$\times$, 61$\times$ speedups over the fully-trained baseline at 50% of dataset
  collection in CIFAR, Imagenet and Amazon Review datasets, respectively, with little
  accuracy loss. We also show that CLActive is robust against catastrophic forgetting
  in a challenging class-incremental active-learning setting. Overall, we believe
  that CLActive can effectively enable rapid prototyping and deployment of deep AL
  algorithms in real-world use cases across a variety of settings.'
