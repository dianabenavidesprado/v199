title: Meta-Gradients in Non-Stationary Environments
abstract: 'Meta-gradient methods (Xu et al., 2018; Zahavy et al., 2020) offer a promising
  solution to the problem of hyperparameter selection and adaptation in non-stationary
  reinforcement learning problems. However, the properties of meta-gradients in such
  environments have not been systematically studied. In this work, we bring new clarity
  to meta-gradients in non-stationary environments. Concretely, we ask: (i) how much
  information should be given to the learned optimizers, so as to enable faster adaptation
  and generalization over a lifetime, (ii) what meta-optimizer functions are learned
  in this process, and (iii) whether meta-gradient methods provide a bigger advantage
  in highly non-stationary environments. To study the effect of information provided
  to the meta-optimizer, as in recent works (Flennerhaget al., 2021; Almeida et al.,
  2021), we replace the tuned meta-parameters of fixed update rules with learned meta-parameter
  functions of selected context features. The context features carry information about
  agent performance and changes in the environment and hence can inform learned meta-parameter
  schedules. We find that adding more contextual information is generally beneficial,
  leading to faster adaptation of meta-parameter values and increased performance
  over a lifetime. We support these results with a qualitative analysis of resulting
  meta parameter schedules and learned functions of context features. Lastly, we find
  that without context, meta-gradients do not provide a consistent advantage over
  the baseline in highly non-stationary environments. Our findings suggest that contextualizing
  meta-gradients can play a pivotal role in extracting high performance from meta-gradients
  in non-stationary settings.'
