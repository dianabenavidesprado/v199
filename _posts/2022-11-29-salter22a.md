title: 'MO2: Model-Based Offline Options'
abstract: The ability to discover useful behaviours from past experience and transfer
  them to new tasks is considered a core component of natural embodied intelligence.  Inspired
  by neuroscience, discovering behaviours that switch at bottleneck states have been
  long sought after for inducing plans of minimum description length across tasks.  Prior
  approaches have either only supported online, on-policy, bottleneck state discovery,
  limiting sample-efficiency, or discrete state-action domains, restricting applicability.  To
  address this,  we introduce Model-Based Offline Options (MO2),  an offline hindsight
  framework supporting sample-efficient bottleneck option discovery over continuous
  state-action spaces.  Once bottleneck options are learnt offline over source domains,  they
  are transferred online to improve exploration and value estimation on the transfer
  domain.  Our experiments show that on complex long-horizon continuous control tasks
  with sparse, delayed rewards, MO2â€™s properties are essential and lead to performance
  exceeding recent option learning methods. Additional ablations further demonstrate
  the impact on option predictability and credit assignment.
