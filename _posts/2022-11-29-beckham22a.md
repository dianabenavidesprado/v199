title: Overcoming challenges in leveraging GANs for few-shot data augmentation
abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of GAN-based few-shot data augmentation
  as a method to improve few-shot classification performance. We perform an exploration
  into how a GAN can be fine-tuned for such a task (one of which is in a \emph{class-incremental}
  manner), as well as a rigorous empirical investigation into how well these models
  can perform to improve few-shot classification. We identify issues related to the
  difficulty of training and applying such generative models under a purely supervised
  regime with very few examples, as well as issues regarding the evaluation protocols
  of existing works. We also find that in this regime, classification accuracy is
  highly sensitive to how the classes of the dataset are randomly split. To address
  difficulties in applying these generative models under the few-shot regime, we propose
  a simple and pragmatic semi-supervised fine-tuning approach, and demonstrate gains
  in FID and precision-recall metrics as well as classification performance.
