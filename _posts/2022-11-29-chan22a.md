title: Zipfian Environments for Reinforcement Learning
abstract: As humans and animals learn in the natural world, they encounter distributions
  of entities, situations and events that are far from uniform. Typically, a relatively
  small set of experiences are encountered frequently, while many important experiences
  occur only rarely. The highly-skewed, heavy-tailed nature of reality poses particular
  learning challenges that humans and animals have met by evolving specialised memory
  systems. By contrast, most popular RL environments and benchmarks involve approximately
  uniform variation of properties, objects, situations or tasks. How will RL algorithms
  perform in worlds (like ours) where the distribution of environment features is
  far less uniform? To explore this question, we develop three complementary RL environments
  where the agent’s experience varies according to a Zipfian (discrete power law)
  distribution. These environments will be made available as an open source library.
  On these benchmarks, we find that standard Deep RL architectures and algorithms
  acquire useful knowledge of common situations and tasks, but fail to adequately
  learn about rarer ones. To understand this failure better, we explore how different
  aspects of current approaches may be adjusted to help improve performance on rare
  events, and show that the RL objective function, the agent’s memory system and self-supervised
  learning objectives can all influence an agent’s ability to learn from uncommon
  experiences. Together, these results show that learning robustly from skewed experience
  is a critical challenge for applying Deep RL methods beyond simulations or laboratories,
  and our Zipfian environments provide a basis for measuring future progress towards
  this goal.
