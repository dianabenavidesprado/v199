title: Benchmarking Learning Efficiency in Deep Reservoir Computing
abstract: It is common to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model by
  measuring its predictive power on a test dataset. This approach favors complicated
  models that can smoothly fit complex functions and generalize well from training
  data points. Although essential components of intelligence, speed and data efficiency
  of this learning process are rarely reported or compared between different candidate
  models. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark of increasingly difficult tasks
  together with a data efficiency metric to measure how quickly machine learning models
  learn from training data. We compare the learning speed of some established sequential
  supervised models, such as RNNs, LSTMs, or Transformers, with relatively less known
  alternative models based on reservoir computing. The proposed tasks require a wide
  range of computational primitives, such as memory or the ability to compute Boolean
  functions, to be effectively solved. Surprisingly, we observe that reservoir computing
  systems that rely on dynamically evolving feature maps learn faster than fully supervised
  methods trained with stochastic gradient optimization while achieving comparable
  accuracy scores. The code, benchmark, trained models, and results to reproduce our
  experiments are available at \url{https://github.com/hugcis/benchmark_learning_efficiency}.
