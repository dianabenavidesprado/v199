title: Continual Learning of Dynamical Systems With Competitive Federated Reservoir
  Computing
abstract: Machine learning recently proved efficient in learning differential equations
  and dynamical systems from data. However, the data is commonly assumed to originate
  from a single never-changing system. In contrast, when modeling real-world dynamical
  processes, the data distribution often shifts due to changes in the underlying system
  dynamics. Continual learning of these processes aims to rapidly adapt to abrupt
  system changes without forgetting previous dynamical regimes. This work proposes
  an approach to continual learning based on reservoir computing, a state-of-the-art
  method for training recurrent neural networks on complex spatiotemporal dynamical
  systems. Reservoir computing fixes the recurrent network weights - hence these cannot
  be forgotten - and only updates linear projection heads to the output. We propose
  to train multiple competitive prediction heads concurrently. Inspired by neuroscienceâ€™s
  predictive coding, only the most predictive heads activate, laterally inhibiting
  and thus protecting the inactive heads from forgetting induced by interfering parameter
  updates. We show that this multi-head reservoir minimizes interference and catastrophic
  forgetting on several dynamical systems, including the Van-der-Pol oscillator, the
  chaotic Lorenz attractor, and the high-dimensional Lorenz-96 weather model. Our
  results suggest that reservoir computing is a promising candidate framework for
  the continual learning of dynamical systems. We provide our code for data generation,
  method, and comparisons at \url{https://github.com/leonardbereska/multiheadreservoir.}
