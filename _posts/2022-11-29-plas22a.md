title: Predictive Learning Enables Neural Networks to Learn Complex Working Memory
  Tasks
abstract: Brains are thought to engage in predictive learning - learning to predict
  upcoming stimuli - to construct an internal model of their environment. This is
  especially notable for spatial navigation, as first described by Tolmanâ€™s latent
  learning tasks. However, predictive learning has also been observed in sensory cortex,
  in settings unrelated to spatial navigation. Apart from normative frameworks such
  as active inference or efficient coding, what could be the utility of learning to
  predict the patterns of occurrence of correlated stimuli? Here we show that prediction,
  and thereby the construction of an internal model of sequential stimuli, can bootstrap
  the learning process of a working memory task in a recurrent neural network. We
  implemented predictive learning alongside working memory match-tasks, and networks
  emerged to solve the prediction task first by encoding information across time to
  predict upcoming stimuli, and then eavesdropped on this solution to solve the matching
  task. Eavesdropping was most beneficial when neural resources were limited. Hence,
  predictive learning acts as a general neural mechanism to learn to store sensory
  information that can later be essential for working memory tasks.
