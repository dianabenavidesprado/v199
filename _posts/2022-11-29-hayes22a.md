title: Online Continual Learning for Embedded Devices
abstract: 'Real-time on-device continual learning is needed for new applications such
  as home robots, user personalization on smartphones, and augmented/virtual reality
  headsets. However, this setting poses unique challenges: embedded devices have limited
  memory and compute capacity and conventional machine learning models suffer from
  catastrophic forgetting when updated on non-stationary data streams. While several
  online continual learning models have been developed, their effectiveness for embedded
  applications has not been rigorously studied. In this paper, we first identify criteria
  that online continual learners must meet to effectively perform real-time, on-device
  learning. We then study the efficacy of several online continual learning methods
  when used with mobile neural networks. We measure their performance, memory usage,
  compute requirements, and ability to generalize to out-of-domain inputs.'
