title: Optimal Transport meets Noisy Label Robust Loss and MixUp Regularization for
  Domain Adaptation
abstract: 'It is common in computer vision to be confronted with domain shift: images
  which have the same class but different acquisition conditions. In domain adaptation
  (DA), one wants to classify unlabeled target images using source labeled images.
  Unfortunately, deep neural networks trained on a source training set perform poorly
  on target images which do not belong to the training domain. One strategy to improve
  these performances is to align the source and target image distributions in an embedded
  space using optimal transport (OT). To compute OT, most methods use the minibatch
  optimal transport approximation which causes negative transfer, i.e. aligning samples
  with different labels, and leads to overfitting. In this work, we mitigate negative
  alignment by explaining it as a noisy label assignment to target images. We then
  mitigate its effect by appropriate regularization. We propose to couple the MixUp
  regularization with a loss that is robust to noisy labels in order to improve domain
  adaptation performance. We show in an extensive ablation study that a combination
  of the two techniques is critical to achieve improved performance. Finally, we evaluate
  our method, called mixunbot, on several benchmarks and real-world DA problems.'
