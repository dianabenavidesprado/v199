title: 'TAG: Task-based Accumulated Gradients for Lifelong learning'
abstract: When an agent encounters a continual stream of new tasks in the lifelong
  learning setting, it leverages the knowledge it gained from the earlier tasks to
  help learn the new tasks better. In such a scenario, identifying an efficient knowledge
  representation becomes a challenging problem. Most research works propose to either
  store a subset of examples from the past tasks in a replay buffer, dedicate a separate
  set of parameters to each task or penalize excessive updates over parameters by
  introducing a regularization term. While existing methods employ the general task-agnostic
  stochastic gradient descent update rule, we propose a task-aware optimizer that
  adapts the learning rate based on the relatedness among tasks. We utilize the directions
  taken by the parameters during the updates by additively accumulating the gradients
  specific to each task. These task-based accumulated gradients act as a knowledge
  base that is maintained and updated throughout the stream. We empirically show that
  our proposed adaptive learning rate not only accounts for catastrophic forgetting
  but also exhibits knowledge transfer. We also show that our method performs better
  than several state-of-the-art methods in lifelong learning on complex datasets.
  Moreover, our method can also be combined with the existing methods and achieve
  substantial improvement in performance.
