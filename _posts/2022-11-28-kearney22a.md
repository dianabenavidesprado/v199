title: What Should I Know? Using Meta-Gradient Descent for Predictive Feature Discovery
  in a Single Stream of Experience
abstract: 'In computational reinforcement learning, a growing body of work seeks to
  construct an agent’s perception of the world through predictions of future sensations;
  predictions about environment observations are used as additional input features
  to enable better goal-directed decision-making. An open challenge in this line of
  work is determining from the infinitely many predictions that the agent could possibly
  make which predictions might best support decision-making. This challenge is especially
  apparent in continual learning problems where a single stream of experience is available
  to a singular agent. As a primary contribution, we introduce a meta-gradient descent
  process by which an agent learns 1) what predictions to make, 2) the estimates for
  its chosen predictions, and 3) how to use learned estimates to generate policies
  that maximize future reward—all during a single ongoing process of continual learning.
  In this manuscript we consider predictions expressed as General Value Functions:
  temporally extended estimates of the accumulation of a future signal. We demonstrate
  that through interaction with the environment an agent can independently select
  predictions that resolve partial-observability, resulting in performance similar
  to, or better than expertly chosen General Value Functions in two domains. By learning,
  rather than manually specifying these predictions, we enable the agent to identify
  useful predictions in a self-supervised manner, taking a step towards truly autonomous
  systems.'
