title: 'A Rule-based Shield: Accumulating Safety Rules from Catastrophic Action Effects'
abstract: Deploying autonomous agents in the real-world can lead to risks both to
  the agents and to the humans with whom they interact. As a result, it is essential
  for agents to try to achieve their objectives while acting as safely as possible.
  Thus, learning agents ought to learn not only about the effectiveness of actions,
  but also about their safety. While action effectiveness is task-dependent, information
  regarding the safety of actions can be preserved even if the task and/or the objective
  of the agent changes. The focus of this work is to leverage information from unsafe
  situations that the agent has experienced in order to obtain safety rules that identify
  which action from which state can lead to unsafe outcomes. These rules can be used
  for shielding the agent from repeating the same mistakes, as well as other mistakes
  that lead to the same catastrophic outcomes. In essence, before each action is selected
  for execution by the policy, actions which violate one of the safety rules from
  the current state are masked away and will not be selected. The cumulative set of
  safety rules can be used even when the agent faces multiple tasks, and can also
  be shared between different agents, so that mistakes that were made by one agent
  are not repeated by any of the agents that share the same rule-based shield. The
  process of learning a rule-based shield online is studied on a multi-task autonomous
  driving problem. Finally, the application of a rule-based shield to the Proximal
  Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is empirically evaluated and compared with the
  original PPO, with variants of PPO which use other online-learned shields, and with
  other baselines from the safe reinforcement learning literature. The results show
  that safety rules can significantly reduce the number of unsafe outcomes that agents
  experience, while even improving the cumulative rewards obtained by the agents.
