title: Continual Unsupervised Learning for Optical Flow Estimation with Deep Networks
abstract: In the last few years there has been a growing interest in approaches that
  allow neural networks to learn how to predict optical flow, both in a supervised
  and, more recently, unsupervised manner. While this clearly opens up the possibility
  of learning to estimate optical flow in a truly lifelong setting, by processing
  a potentially endless video stream, existing techniques assume to have access to
  large datasets and they perform stochastic mini-batch-based gradient optimization,
  paired with further ad-hoc components. We present an extensive study on how neural
  networks can learn to estimate optical flow in a continual manner while observing
  a long video stream and reacting online to the streamed information without any
  further data buffering. To this end, we rely on photo-realistic video streams that
  we specifically created using 3D virtual environments, as well as on a real-world
  movie. Our analysis considers important model selection issues that might be easily
  overlooked at a first glance, comparing different neural architectures and also
  state-of-the-art models  pretrained in an offline manner. Our results not only show
  the feasibility of continual unsupervised learning in optical flow estimation, but
  also indicate that the learned models, in several situations, are comparable to
  state-of-the-art offline-pretrained networks. Moreover, we show how common issues
  in continual learning, such as catastrophic forgetting, do not affect the proposed
  models in a disruptive manner, given the task at hand.
