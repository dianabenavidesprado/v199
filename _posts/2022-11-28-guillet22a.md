title: Neural Distillation as a State Representation Bottleneck in Reinforcement Learning
abstract: 'Learning a good state representation is a critical skill when dealing with
  multiple tasks in Reinforcement Learning as it allows for transfer and better generalization
  between tasks. However, defining what constitute a useful representation is far
  from simple and there is so far no standard method to find such an encoding. In
  this paper, we argue that distillation — a process that aims at imitating a set
  of given policies with a single neural network — can be used to learn a state representation
  displaying favorable characteristics. In this regard, we define three criteria that
  measure desirable features of a state encoding: the ability to select important
  variables in the input space, the ability to efficiently separate states according
  to their corresponding optimal action, and the robustness of the state encoding
  on new tasks. We first evaluate these criteria and verify the contribution of distillation
  on state representation on a toy environment based on the standard inverted pendulum
  problem, before extending our analysis on more complex visual tasks from the Atari
  and Procgen benchmarks.'
