title: Simulation-Acquired Latent Action Spaces for Dynamics Generalization
abstract: 'Deep reinforcement learning has shown incredible promise at training high-performing
  agents to solve high-dimensional continuous control tasks in a particular training
  environment. However, to be useful in real-world settings, long-lived agents must
  perform well across a range of environmental conditions. Naively applying deep RL
  to a task where environment conditions may vary from episode to episode can be data
  inefficient. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a method that discovers
  structure in an agentâ€™s high-dimensional continuous action space to speed up learning
  across a range of environmental conditions. Whereas prior work on finding so-called
  latent action spaces requires expert demonstrations or on-task experience, we instead
  propose to discover the latent, lower-dimensional action space in a simulated source
  environment and then transfer the learned action space for training in the target
  environment. We evaluate our novel method on randomized variants of simulated MuJoCo
  environments and find that, when there is a lower-dimensional action-space to exploit,
  our method significantly increases data efficiency. For instance, in the Ant environment,
  our method reduces the 8-dimensional action-space to a 3-dimensional action-space
  and doubles the average return achieved after a training budget of 2 million timesteps. '
