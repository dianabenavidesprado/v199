title: Reactive Exploration to Cope With Non-Stationarity in Lifelong Reinforcement
  Learning
abstract: In lifelong learning an agent learns throughout its entire life without
  resets, in a constantly changing environment, as we humans do. Consequently, lifelong
  learning comes with a plethora of research problems such as continual domain shifts,
  which result in non-stationary rewards and environmental dynamics. These non-stationarities,
  however, are difficult to detect and cope with due to their continuous nature. Therefore,
  exploration strategies and learning methods are required that are capable of tracking
  the steady domain shifts, and adapting to them. We propose Reactive Exploration
  to track and react to continual domain shifts in lifelong reinforcement learning,
  and to update the policy correspondingly. To this end, we conduct experiments in
  order to investigate different exploration strategies. We empirically show that
  policy-gradient algorithms are better suited for lifelong learning, as they adapt
  more quickly to distribution shifts than Q-learning. Thereby, policy-gradient methods
  profit the most from Reactive Exploration and show good results in lifelong learning
  with continual domain shifts.
