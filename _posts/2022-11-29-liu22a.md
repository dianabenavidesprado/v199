title: Continual Learning and Private Unlearning
abstract: As intelligent agents become autonomous over longer periods of time, they
  may eventually become lifelong counterparts to specific people. If so, it may be
  common for a user to want the agent to master a task temporarily but later on to
  forget the task due to privacy concerns. However enabling an agent to forget privately
  what the user specified without degrading the rest of the learned knowledge is a
  challenging problem. With the aim of addressing this challenge, this paper formalizes
  this continual learning and private unlearning (CLPU) problem. The paper further
  introduces a straightforward but exactly private solution, CLPU-DER++, as the first
  step towards solving the CLPU problem, along with a set of carefully designed benchmark
  problems to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.
