title: 'SHELS: Exclusive Feature Sets for Novelty Detection and Continual Learning
  Without Class Boundaries'
abstract: While deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved impressive classification
  performance in closed-world learning scenarios, they typically fail to generalize
  to unseen categories in dynamic open-world environments, in which the number of
  concepts is unbounded. In contrast, human and animal learners have the ability to
  incrementally update their knowledge by recognizing and adapting to novel observations.
  In particular, humans characterize concepts via exclusive (unique) sets of essential
  features, which are used for both recognizing known classes and identifying novelty.
  Inspired by natural learners, we introduce a Sparse High-level-Exclusive, Low-level-Shared
  feature representation (SHELS) that simultaneously encourages learning exclusive
  sets of high-level features and essential, shared low-level features. The exclusivity
  of the high-level features enables the DNN to automatically detect out-of-distribution
  (OOD) data, while the efficient use of capacity via sparse low-level features permits
  accommodating new knowledge. The resulting approach uses OOD detection to perform
  class-incremental continual learning without known class boundaries. We show that
  using SHELS for novelty detection results in statistically significant improvements
  over state-of-the-art OOD detection approaches over a variety of benchmark datasets.
  Further, we demonstrate that the SHELS model mitigates catastrophic forgetting in
  a class-incremental learning setting, enabling a combined novelty detection and
  accommodation framework that supports learning in open-world settings.
