title: Continual Learning through Hamilton Equations
abstract: Learning in a continual manner is one of the main challenges that the machine
  learning community is currently facing. The importance of the problem can be readily
  understood as soon as we consider settings where an agent is supposed to learn through
  an online interaction with a data stream, rather than operating offline on previously
  prepared data collections. In the last few years many efforts have been spent in
  proposing both models and algorithms to let machines learn in a continual manner,
  and the problem still remains extremely challenging.  Many of the existing works
  rely on re-adapting the usual learning framework inherited from classic statistical
  approaches, that are typical of non-continual-learning oriented problems.  In this
  paper we consider a fully new perspective, rethinking the methodologies to be used
  to tackle continual learning, instead of re-adapting offline-oriented optimization.  In
  particular, we propose a novel method to frame continual and online learning within
  the framework of optimal control. The proposed formulation leads to a novel interpretation
  of learning dynamics in terms of Hamilton equations.  As a case study for the theory,
  we consider the problem of unsupervised optical flow estimation from a video stream.
  An experimental proof of concept for this learning task is discussed with the purpose
  of illustrating the soundness of the proposed approach, and opening to further research
  in this direction.
