title: 'Heat-RL: Online Model Selection for Streaming Time-Series Anomaly Detection'
abstract: Time-series anomaly detection plays an important role in various applications.
  In a commercial system, anomaly detection models are either unsupervised or pre-trained
  in a self-supervised manner offline; while in the online serving stage, an appropriate
  model should be selected to fulfill each customerâ€™s requirement with only a few
  human interactions. Existing online model selection methods do not have good data
  efficiency, failing to achieve good performance with limited number of manual feedbacks.
  In this paper, we propose Heat-RL, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm tailored
  to online model selection for streaming time-series data. Specifically, we design
  a new state based on metric-oriented heatmaps and apply ResNet for policy and value
  networks to capture the correlations among similar model configurations. Experiments
  demonstrated the effectiveness of Heat-RL on both academic and industrial datasets.
  On all datasets, the average F1 and last F1 scores have been improved by 5.5% and
  14.6% respectively compared to the best state-of-the-art solution.
