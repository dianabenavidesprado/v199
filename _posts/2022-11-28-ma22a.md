title: 'EFL: Elastic Federated Learning on Non-IID Data'
abstract: Federated learning involves training machine learning models over devices
  or data silos, such as edge processors or data warehouses while keeping the data
  local. However, training in heterogeneous and potentially massive networks introduces
  bias into the system, originating from the non-IID data and the low participation
  rate. In this paper, we propose Elastic Federated Learning (EFL), an unbiased federated
  training framework capable of tackling the heterogeneity in the system. EFL extends
  lifelong learning to realistic federated settings, makes the most informative parameters
  less volatile during training, and utilizes incomplete local updates. It is also
  an efficient and effective algorithm that compresses upstream and downstream communications
  with a convergence guarantee. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our framework
  on a variety of non-IID datasets and show the competitive performance of the algorithm
  on robustness and efficiency.
